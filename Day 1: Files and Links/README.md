## Day 1: Enter the Raspberry Pi

Today we set up a Raspberry Pi using New Out Of Box Software.

We will then set up your Raspberry Pi to run Linux's Rasbian flavor

### Installation

Download <strong>SD Formatter</strong> and the <strong>NOOBS.zip</strong>
from this website: http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads


## Setup 

First up, your Raspberry Pi thinks it is still in Britain, as such you are unable to use the " or @ signs (which are in a different location on British keys).

### Changing the Locale

1. Select <strong> Internationalization Options</strong> and use the arrow keys to scroll down until you see the '*' next to English UK
2. <strong>Use the spacebar</strong> to unselect that option, then again use the spacebar to select the option for  <strong>English US UTF 8</strong>
3. press okay for the remaining of the options


### Chaging the Keyboard

1. Again select <strong>Internationalisation Options</strong> but not select the keyboard.
2. Change the selection to the "Generic 104 Keyboard" option
3. Then on the next menu, select "other" instead of English UK
4. Change it to the English US option
5. Then select the regular English US option on the next screen
6. Finally press "okay" for the remaining options


Whew!  You have a working Raspberry Pi ! :smiley:
